## <div align="center">Lab 06</div>

## Objectives:  
* Developing a proper app using Model View Controller (MVC) and to write UIKit code directly without using Playground

## Exercise 0:

1. Login to your GitHub account
2. Run the following link to create Lab05 to your Github account https://classroom.github.com/a/v3R61lWY
3. You have to do the exercises given in the repository and commit and push your solutions into it.

## Exercise 1:

Note : Please go through these material in your personal computer and get an idea about what you are doing.  The MVC pattern is a common design pattern used in developing UIKit Based applications.

1. In this Lab we will start using the Apple official iOS App Development Tutorial on using UIKit
2. The start of the Tutorial is at https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/#uikit-essentials
3. Please go through the first section https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/getting-started-with-today
4. Please do the Hands on Lab given at https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/creating-a-list-view
5. Capture two screen shots and add to your repo of your simulated running application (iphone and ipad)
6. Commit and Push your code to the repository

## Exercise 2:

Note : Using Playground for UIKit has its issues and in the Industry, iOS software engineers use a code based approach to develop UIKit based applications. Here too have a look at these resources clearly before trying this in your Mac Computer or Instance.

1. Go through the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U6_l58Cv4E (optional)
2. Go through the article and video provided at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/8/2/building-a-uikit-user-interface-programmatically
3. Try your best to at least partially complete this Exercise, so you have an idea of how code based UIKit development is done
4. Capture two screen shots and add to your repo of your simulated running application (iphone and ipad)
5. Commit and Push your code to the repository
