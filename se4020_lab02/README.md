## <div align="center">Lab 02</div>

## Objectives:  
* Use XCode to develop a simple UIKit based Lab
* Experiment with basic Swift Language Commands

## Exercise 0:

1. Login to your GitHub account
2. Run the following link to create Lab02 to your Github account https://classroom.github.com/a/gs9WLLAj
3. You have to do the exercises given in the repository and commit and push your solutions into it.

## Exercise 1:

1. Go through the two pdf documents provided in the courseweb about Using XCode and also about Lab02 Resource
2. Login to a Apple Mac using instructions provided
3. Follow the instructions provided in the Lab02 Resource and complete the Lab
4. Use any approach that is comfortable to you to save the code you have written so that it can be pushed to your Lab02 Repo
5. Capture two screen shots and add to your repo of your simulated running application (iphone and ipad)
6. Commit and Push your code to the repository

## Exercise 2:

You can use replit.com or Swift Playground if you don't have access to a dedicated Apple Device for this Exercise

1. Create two optional String variables firstname and lastname and assign valid values
2. Use force unwrap to display them together in one line
3. Create two other optional String variables to store details of firstname and lastname
4. Use optional binding as below to safely unwrap the two variables and print the names
```
if let unwrappedValue = optionalValue {
    // use unwrappedValue here
} else {
    // optionalValue was nil, handle the case
}
```
5. Set one of the names (firstname and lastname) to ```nil``` and see if the valid name is printed
6. Commit your solution in Exercise 02


## Exercise 3:

You can use replit.com or Swift Playground if you don't have access to a dedicated Apple Device for this Exercise

Write a program to input from the keyboard the student id and marks of a student.  The student can have multiple marks. Use a sentinal value of -999 to stop inputing marks.  Calculate and print the student's average marks

Note
1. Safely unwrap the inputs from the keyboard
2. Use an appropriate loop to get the multiple marks
3. Display the student id and the average marks
4. Commit your solution in Exercise 03


## Exercise 4:

You can use replit.com or Swift Playground if you don't have access to a dedicated Apple Device for this Exercise

1.	Write a program to store GPAs of graduating students.  Each student should have the 4 GPAs representing each year of study.  Use an appropriate data structure to capture details of multiple students.  Calculate the WGPA of each student taking 0% of Year 1, 20% of Year 2, 30% of Year 3 and 50% of Year 4 and display the class the student gets based on SLIIT's rules and regulations.

## Exercise 5:

You can use replit.com or Swift Playground if you don't have access to a dedicated Apple Device for this Exercise

1.	Write simple programs that illustrate the use of the following commands that you have learnt. You can combine a few of these into one program or have multiple programs highlighting the use of these commands and data structures
2.	if, switch, ranges, while, repeat, array, dictionary, set and optionals
